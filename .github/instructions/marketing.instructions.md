# Marketing Instructions

## Core Philosophy

**Products don't succeed by talking about their biggest features. They succeed by solving users' biggest needs.**

Your role is to identify and communicate how Tabby solves real user problems, not to list technical capabilities.

## Key Principle: Outcomes Over Features

### ❌ Don't Lead With Features

"Advanced Tab Manager with Fuzzy Search, Keyboard Shortcuts, and Theme Customization"

**Why this fails:**

- Describes what the software _is_, not what it _does for the user_
- Blends into noise of similar-sounding competitors
- Makes users think, not feel
- Appeals to logic, not emotion

### ✅ Lead With Outcomes

"Find any tab in seconds. Navigate Chrome at the speed of thought."

**Why this works:**

- Describes what changes for the user
- Creates immediate value clarity
- Emotional resonance (speed, clarity, control)
- Memorable and differentiated

## Understanding User Needs

### What Users Actually Want

Most people do NOT want "better tab management."

**They want:**

- "I have too many tabs and can't find anything" → **Clarity from chaos**
- "Chrome feels slow with all these tabs" → **Performance without sacrifice**
- "I lose tabs I need later" → **Confidence and control**
- "Switching between work and personal is messy" → **Context organization**
- "I waste time hunting for that one tab" → **Speed and efficiency**
- "I miss Arc but won't switch browsers" → **Best workflow, familiar browser**

**Your job:** Translate features into these emotional outcomes.

## Target Personas & Their Needs

### Researcher (Sarah)

**Pain:** "I'm drowning in research tabs across multiple topics and can't keep track"

**Need:** Organization and retrieval without closing tabs

**Language:**

- "See all your research in one place"
- "Jump between projects instantly"
- "Never lose track of important tabs"
- "Organize by topic, not tab count"

### Developer (Marcus)

**Pain:** "Switching between docs, staging, prod, and code is too slow and mouse-heavy"

**Need:** Keyboard-first speed and efficiency

**Language:**

- "Navigate at keyboard speed"
- "Command palette for your browser"
- "Stop hunting for tabs"
- "Work in flow"

### General User (Alex)

**Pain:** "I have 83 tabs and Chrome is slow and overwhelming"

**Need:** Simple solution to tab overload

**Language:**

- "Tame tab chaos in seconds"
- "Find anything instantly"
- "Your tabs, finally under control"
- "Chrome, but organized"

## Positioning Strategy

### Core Positioning

**For Chrome users** who are overwhelmed by too many tabs and constant context switching,  
**Tabby** is a keyboard-first command center for tabs, windows, and bookmarks  
**That** brings Arc-like productivity to Chrome without switching browsers,  
**Unlike** Chrome's built-in tab management or heavyweight alternatives that slow you down.

### Differentiation

**What makes Tabby unique:**

1. **Keyboard-first by design** - Not just "supports" keyboard, but _optimized_ for it
2. **Privacy-focused** - All processing local, no accounts, no tracking, no cloud
3. **Stays in Chrome** - Get Arc-like workflow without switching browsers
4. **Lightweight** - Fast, not bloated with unnecessary features
5. **Themeable personality** - Make it yours with 15+ accent palettes

### Competitive Positioning

**vs. Arc Browser:**
"Love Arc's workflow but don't want to switch browsers? Tabby brings that speed and clarity to Chrome."

**vs. Chrome Native:**
"Chrome's built-in tabs break down after ~20 tabs. Tabby scales to 200+."

**vs. Other Extensions:**
"Most tab managers are slow, cluttered, or invasive. Tabby is fast, focused, and private."

## Messaging Framework

1-2 sentences explaining the core benefit:

**❌ Don't:**

- Use jargon: "leveraging", "synergize", "paradigm"
- Overuse superlatives: "best", "ultimate", "revolutionary"
- Make unverifiable claims: "10x faster" without proof
- Speak in features: "fuzzy search algorithm" → "instant search"

"Stop losing tabs in the chaos. Tabby's side panel shows all your windows and tabs in one organized view. Find anything in seconds.

Free on Chrome Web Store 🔗"

**Reddit (Longer Context):**
Lead with the problem, show your solution, invite discussion

"I built a Chrome extension because I had 100+ tabs and couldn't find anything. Tabby adds an omnibar (like Cmd+K) and side panel view for all tabs. Keyboard-first, privacy-focused, free. What's your tab count? [Link]"

### Blog Posts / Launch Announcements

**Structure:**

1. **Identify pain point** - Story about tab chaos
2. **Explain the need** - Why existing solutions fail
3. **Introduce solution** - How Tabby helps
4. **Show it in action** - Screenshots/video
5. **Call to action** - Try it free

### Email / Newsletter

**Subject lines:**

- "Stop hunting for tabs" (outcome)
- "Find any Chrome tab in 2 seconds" (specific benefit)
- "Chrome + Arc's workflow = Tabby" (positioning)

**Body:** Problem → Solution → CTA format, <100 words

## Naming Considerations

### Current Name: Tabby

**Pros:**

- Memorable, friendly
- Related to tabs (obvious function)

**Cons:**

- Might seem casual/unprofessional
- Generic (many "tab" extensions)

### Alternative Directions

**Abstract/Modern:**

- Pane
- Flow
- Dash
- Flux
- Arc (taken), Prism, Orbit

**Benefits:**

- Professional but approachable
- Can grow beyond "tabs" if needed
- Stands out in marketplace

**Trade-offs:**

- Less immediately obvious function
- Requires more explanation at first

**Recommendation:** Consider testing alternatives if aiming for rebrand, but current name is serviceable

## Launch Strategy

### Pre-Launch

1. **Landing page** with email capture
2. **Product Hunt profile** ready
3. **Screenshots** and **demo video** prepared
4. **Social proof** gathered (beta testers)

### Launch Day

1. **Product Hunt** submission with compelling story
2. **Reddit** posts in relevant communities (r/chrome, r/productivity)
3. **Twitter/X** thread showing features
4. **HackerNews** "Show HN" if dev-focused
5. **Email** to waitlist

### Post-Launch

1. **User testimonials** → Website, Chrome Web Store
2. **Case studies** with specific personas
3. **Content marketing** (blog posts about productivity, tab management)
4. **Community building** (Discord, subreddit)

## Metrics That Matter

### Vanity Metrics (Don't Obsess Over)

- Total installs
- Social media followers
- Page views

### Actionable Metrics (Focus Here)

- **Activation rate:** % who use core feature after install
- **Retention:** % who return after 7 days, 30 days
- **User satisfaction:** Qualitative feedback, ratings
- **Conversion:** Free → Paid (if applicable)
- **Word-of-mouth:** Organic mentions, shares

## Remember

**The best marketing:**

- **Starts with real user pain** (not your cool feature)
- **Shows outcomes, not features** (what changes, not what exists)
- **Uses simple language** (your users' words, not yours)
- **Builds trust** (social proof, transparency, privacy)
- **Makes you feel something** (frustration → relief → delight)

**A product isn't successful for talking about its biggest features, but for how it solves its users' biggest needs.**
