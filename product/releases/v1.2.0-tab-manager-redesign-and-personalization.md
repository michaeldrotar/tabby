# Tab Manager Redesign and Personalization 🎨

**Version:** 1.2.0
**Release Date:** December 17, 2024

This release transforms Tabby with full theming support and a completely redesigned Tab Manager. Personalize every part of the interface with your choice of colors and appearance, navigate faster with keyboard shortcuts, and enjoy a cleaner, more streamlined experience throughout.

## What's New

### Personalize Your Theme

Make Tabby yours with flexible theming options across the entire app. Pick your preferred mode (System, Light, or Dark), choose from over 15 accent colors, and adjust how subtle or bold you want the highlights. Your theme preferences apply everywhere—Omnibar, Tab Manager, and Options all share your customized look. Colors adapt automatically between light and dark mode with separate preferences for each.

### Redesigned Tab Manager

A completely new Tab Manager built for speed and clarity. Navigate your tabs and windows without reaching for the mouse—arrow keys move between items instantly, keeping your focus centered. The new compact sidebar shows all your windows at a glance with tab counts and quick actions. Choose between icon-only or list layouts to match how you work.

### Smarter Search Results

Omnibar now prioritizes recently accessed items, so tabs you opened minutes ago appear near the top instead of being buried below results from weeks ago. Finding what you just looked at is now much more reliable.

### Cleaner Settings

The Options page is now easier to scan with compact dropdowns and better spacing. Tab Manager preferences have their own dedicated section. If you ever want to start fresh, the new Reset button clears all preferences instantly.

### Privacy

The Omnibar popup no longer shows up in your Recently Closed list when you close it with `Cmd+W` or `Ctrl+W`.
