  - **Softer Light Theme**: Light mode surfaces are slightly tinted (less stark white) for a more comfortable look.
  - **Accent Consistency**: Selection/highlight styles now consistently follow the chosen accent color.
- **Interaction**:
  - **Seamless Navigation**: Keyboard navigation now keeps the selected item centered and updates the view instantly.
  - **Focus Management**: Pressing Enter on a window now opens the Tab Manager in that window and scrolls to the active tab.
  - **Faster Select Tweaks**: Use Up/Down arrow keys on a focused Select to cycle options without opening the dropdown.
- **Privacy**: The Omnibar popup window will no longer appear in the "Recently Closed" list when closed with `Cmd+W` / `Ctrl+W`.
- **Performance**: Improved performance when switching between windows.

## Fixes
