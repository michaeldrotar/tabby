## 💎 Omnibar Improvements

We've given the Omnibar a fresh coat of paint to make it even easier to scan your results:

- **Type Indicators**: Clear, color-coded labels now show you exactly what each result is (Tab, Bookmark, History, etc.) at a glance.
- **Better Layout**: URLs are now explicitly shown for bookmarks and history items, so you know exactly where you're going.
- **Search Highlighting**: Matching terms in your search results are now highlighted, making it easier to find what you're looking for.
- **Visual Polish**: Improved spacing, icons, and typography for a smoother experience.
- **Retina Ready**: Favicons now render at 2x resolution for crisp visuals on high-density displays.
- **Google Search Icon**: Web searches now feature the official Google logo for easier recognition.
- **History Age**: See how long ago you visited a history item right in the search results.
- **Recently Closed Tabs**: You can now search for and restore recently closed tabs directly from the Omnibar.
- **Theme Toggle**: Added a new command to quickly toggle between light and dark themes directly from the Omnibar.
- **Smart Ranking**: Search results are now intelligently ranked based on relevance, type, and recency, so the most likely result is always at the top.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Omnibar Navigation**: Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor would interfere with keyboard navigation in the Omnibar.
- **Tab & Command Search**: Fixed an issue where tab and command search required exact phrase matching. Now supports multiple search terms in any order, consistent with history and bookmark search.
