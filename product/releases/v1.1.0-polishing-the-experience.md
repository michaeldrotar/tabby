# Polishing the Experience ✨

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Release Date:** 2025-12-04

## Highlights

- **Faster, clearer searches**: Search results are smarter and easier to scan thanks to improved ranking, highlighted matches, and clearer type labels.
- **Better discoverability**: New quick actions and commands make it easier to find and open the features you need (e.g., Tab Manager, Options, theme toggle).
- **Polished UI across the extension**: Visual improvements (spacing, contrast, higher‑quality favicons, and custom scrollbars) make Tabby feel more modern and reliable.

## Omnibar — Find what you need, faster

- Quick Actions & Empty State: When the Omnibar is empty you’ll see contextual actions (like "Open Tab Manager") and tips to discover shortcuts and features without hunting through menus.
- Smarter Results: Results are now ranked by relevance, type, and recency so the items you want appear near the top.
- Improved Scanability: Search terms are highlighted and each result shows a clear, color-coded type label (Tab, Bookmark, History, etc.), plus URLs for bookmark/history items so you know where a link will go.
- Recently Closed & Access Time: Restore recently closed tabs directly from the Omnibar and see when items were last accessed.
- New Commands: Added quick commands for Password Manager, Clear Browsing Data, toggling themes, and opening the Options page.

## Tab Manager — smoother interactions

- Header shortcuts: A new search button in the Tab Manager header opens the Omnibar (hover shows the shortcut). An Options button gives one-click access to preferences.
- UI fixes: Removed accidental debug labels from tab titles and fixed layout issues that could occur with nested buttons.

## Options Page — simpler configuration

- Redesigned layout: Cleaner, easier-to-scan settings and a persistent theme toggle for quick light/dark switching.
- Shortcut guidance: A direct link to Chrome’s shortcut settings and recommended shortcuts to get you started quickly.
- Side panel placement: Instructions to move the Tab Manager to the left or right side of the browser.

## UI & Visual polish

- Custom, auto-hiding scrollbars for a cleaner look across platforms.
- Retina-ready favicons (2x) for crisp icons on high-density displays.
- Improved spacing, iconography, typography and light-theme contrast to reduce visual noise and improve readability.

## Bug fixes & compatibility

- Windows shortcuts: Adjusted default Windows shortcuts to avoid conflicts with Chrome (now using `Alt+E`, `Alt+K`, and `Alt+Shift+E`).
- Omnibar navigation: Fixed issues where the mouse cursor could interfere with keyboard navigation and where ESC wouldn't reliably close the Omnibar.
- Search behavior: Tab and command search now accepts multiple terms (any order), matching history and bookmark search behavior.
- Layout and interaction fixes: Resolved display issues in the Tab Manager and fixed an error caused by nested header buttons.
