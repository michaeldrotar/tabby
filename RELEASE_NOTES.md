# Release Notes

## v1.0.0 - The Launch 🚀

**Tabby is here!**
We are thrilled to introduce Tabby, your new browser experience. Tabby transforms how you navigate Chrome, turning your browser into a keyboard-centric command line for maximum productivity.

### ✨ What's New

**🔍 The Omnibar (Cmd+E / Ctrl+E)**
Stop hunting for tabs. Press one shortcut to instantly search everything:

- **Universal Search**: Find any open tab, bookmark, or history item in milliseconds.
- **Web Search**: Type your query and jump straight to Google results.
- **Commands**: Run browser actions like opening Settings or managing extensions without touching your mouse.

**🗂️ Tab Manager (Cmd+Shift+E / Ctrl+Shift+E)**
Bring order to the chaos. Our new side panel gives you a bird's-eye view of your browsing session:

- **Multi-Window Support**: See all your open windows in one clean list.
- **Tab Groups**: Visualize and organize your tab groups effortlessly.
- **Fast Switching**: Jump between tabs and windows with a click.

**🔒 Privacy First**
We built Tabby with a "Privacy by Design" philosophy:

- **Zero Data Collection**: Tabby runs 100% locally on your device. No data is ever sent to our servers.
- **On-Demand Access**: We only access your current tab when you explicitly ask us to.
- **Sandboxed UI**: Your search queries are isolated in a secure environment, keeping your history safe from prying eyes.

## v1.1.0 - Polishing the Experience ✨

### 💎 Omnibar Improvements

We've given the Omnibar a fresh coat of paint to make it even easier to scan your results:

- **Type Indicators**: Clear, color-coded labels now show you exactly what each result is (Tab, Bookmark, History, etc.) at a glance.
- **Better Layout**: URLs are now explicitly shown for bookmarks and history items, so you know exactly where you're going.
- **Search Highlighting**: Matching terms in your search results are now highlighted, making it easier to find what you're looking for.
- **Visual Polish**: Improved spacing, icons, and typography for a smoother experience.
- **Retina Ready**: Favicons now render at 2x resolution for crisp visuals on high-density displays.
- **History Age**: See how long ago you visited a history item right in the search results.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Omnibar Navigation**: Fixed an issue where the mouse cursor would interfere with keyboard navigation in the Omnibar.
- **Tab & Command Search**: Fixed an issue where tab and command search required exact phrase matching. Now supports multiple search terms in any order, consistent with history and bookmark search.
