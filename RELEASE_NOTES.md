# Release Notes

## v1.0.0 - The Launch 🚀

**Tabby is here!**
We are thrilled to introduce Tabby, your new browser experience. Tabby transforms how you navigate Chrome, turning your browser into a keyboard-centric command line for maximum productivity.

### ✨ What's New

**🔍 The Omnibar (Cmd+E / Ctrl+E)**
Stop hunting for tabs. Press one shortcut to instantly search everything:

- **Universal Search**: Find any open tab, bookmark, or history item in milliseconds.
- **Web Search**: Type your query and jump straight to Google results.
- **Commands**: Run browser actions like opening Settings or managing extensions without touching your mouse.

**🗂️ Tab Manager (Cmd+Shift+E / Ctrl+Shift+E)**
Bring order to the chaos. Our new side panel gives you a bird's-eye view of your browsing session:

- **Multi-Window Support**: See all your open windows in one clean list.
- **Tab Groups**: Visualize and organize your tab groups effortlessly.
- **Fast Switching**: Jump between tabs and windows with a click.

**🔒 Privacy First**
We built Tabby with a "Privacy by Design" philosophy:

- **Zero Data Collection**: Tabby runs 100% locally on your device. No data is ever sent to our servers.
- **On-Demand Access**: We only access your current tab when you explicitly ask us to.
- **Sandboxed UI**: Your search queries are isolated in a secure environment, keeping your history safe from prying eyes.

### 🐞 Bug Fixes

- **Shortcut Bindings**: Fixed the default shortcut bindings to use Windows keys for non-Mac users. **(v1.0.1)**
